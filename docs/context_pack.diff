 - Decoupled boundary: only HTTP calls to `c4-mcp` (no shared code; configured via `C4_MCP_BASE_URL`).
 - Session context: backend sends `X-Session-Id: <deviceId>` to `c4-mcp` for follow-ups.
 - Ambiguity UX: backend emits `clarification-required`, UI replies `clarification-choice`, backend retries with scoped args.
+- Clarification retry rule: prefer stable identifiers (e.g., `room_id`) when available; avoid re-sending ambiguous `room_name`.
 - Anti-hang: backend enforces `C4_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS` and UI has a watchdog for stuck “executing”.
+- Refactor direction: move toward a more “typical MCP” app layout (clearer domain modules + strict contracts) without breaking REST/WS payloads.

 - “Turn off the TV” then “mute it” succeeds in the same browser session.
 - Follow-up resolution uses `X-Session-Id` + `*_last` tools (no state duplication in this repo).
 
+**Objective D — Prepare the “typical MCP” refactor safely (no contract breaks)**
+
+- Identify/lock the external contracts (REST + WS event names + backend→`c4-mcp` payload shape).
+- Acceptance: existing flows (voice, text, clarification) behave identically; Jest + ESLint stay green.
+- Start from current known-good HEAD; only rewind to an older commit if you have a specific regression you’re escaping.
+- Before refactor code changes: create a baseline tag/branch (e.g., `refactor-baseline-2026-01-26`) for quick rollback and diffing.
+- Refactor in small, testable slices; re-run Jest + ESLint after each slice.

 ## Guardrails block (from conventions)
 
 - Node.js: compatible with Node 18+; avoid native addons.
 - Keep repos decoupled: never add shared code that couples `c4-mcp-app` to `c4-mcp` internals.
 - Do not re-implement memory here; always rely on `c4-mcp` session memory via `X-Session-Id`.
 - Do not break REST/WS/MCP payload shapes; changes must be additive and backwards-compatible.
+- Refactor direction: restructure internals (module boundaries, file sizes, clearer orchestration) but keep the wire contracts stable.
 - Keep all tool executions bounded: enforce `C4_MCP_TIMEOUT_MS`; never allow indefinite hangs.
 - No secrets in git; only `.env`/deployment secrets stores.
 - Keep tests/lint green (Jest + ESLint) for any backend changes.
